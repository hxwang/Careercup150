//let c denote the number of blue-eyed people

//if c=1, then take 1 day, since we assume there is at least 1 blue-eyed people

//if c=2; then on the first day, no one leave; which indicates there are more than 1 blue-eyed pepple, so in the second day, they leave

//if c =3; then if no one leave on the second day, it means there are more than 2 people, thus on the 3rd day they leave

//if c = k, then it takes k days for the blue eyed people to leave
