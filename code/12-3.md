### My design
- normal cases
- extrem cases
- null input, illegal input
- strange input


### References
- note that for the extrem cases, you need to consider
  - board is full?
  - more white than black?
  - empty board?
- for normal test cases, since you can not test all, you need to design some structure for the testing
  - e.g., there are 6 pieces in total
  - for each a
  -     for each b
  -        for each direction d
  -            create a, place b in direction d
  -               test move
