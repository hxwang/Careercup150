### My design
- Approach 1: use a hash table to maintain what has been visited
  - Drawback: the table could be very large
- Approach 2: random walk
  - Pros: do not need to keep state
  - Cons: may have duplications
  
### References
- Approach 1: use hash table
  - what to be a key: note that the url of one page is not unique
- Approach 2: use similarity
  - use database to maintain the web that are visited
