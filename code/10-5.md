### My design
- Approach 1: use a hash table to maintain what has been visited
  - Drawback: the table could be very large
- Approach 2: random walk
  - Pros: do not need to keep state
  - Cons: may have duplications
  
### References
- Approach 1: use hash table
  - what to be a key: note that the url of one page is not unique
- Approach 2: use similarity
  - use database to maintain the list of items to be visited
  - open a page, create a subsection of the page and its url, get its signature
  - query the database to see if anything similar to this signature has been visited
  - if some page similar to this signature have been crawled, insert this page to the database with lower priority
  - otherwise, visited it, and insert it back
