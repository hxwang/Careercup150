### My design
- unerstand the scenario
  - environment it is running on, is it because of the C library not there, or out of version?
  - any hint on launch the app
  - any specific operation result in crash
  
  
### References
- random variable?
- uninitialized variable?
- memory leak?
- external dependencies? e.g., the program may depend on another program
