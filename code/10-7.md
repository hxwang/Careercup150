### My design
- Hash query to get the machine to respond, and cache query
  - For the respond mechine m1, it will hash(query) to get the machine m2 to handle the query
  - m2 then return the result to m1, then m1 respond to query 
- Pros:
  - easy to maintain 
- Cons:
  - how to deal with failure?
  

### References
- First, consider single machine
  - use linkedlist to maintain cache, easy to insert to front (keep order)
  - also use hashmap to maintain cache, easy to check whether exist
