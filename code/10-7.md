### My design
- Hash query to get the machine to respond, and cache query
  - For the respond mechine m1, it will hash(query) to get the machine m2 to handle the query
  - m2 then return the result to m1, then m1 respond to query 
- Pros:
  - easy to maintain 
- Cons:
  - how to deal with failure?
  

### References
- First, consider single machine
  - use linkedlist to maintain cache, easy to insert to front (keep order)
  - also use hashmap to maintain cache, easy to check whether exist
  - [code](./10-7.java)
- Multiple machines
  - let each machine stores a segment of the cache, use (query)%machine number to find the machine.
- Further improvements: what if some pages are very popular
  - cache these queries on multiple machines
  - send out "on demand"
  - Problem: how to deal with outdated queries?
    - timeout, e.g., time could be different based on topic
