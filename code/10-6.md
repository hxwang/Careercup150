### My design
- If the memory is large enough
  - use hashtable
- If the memory is not large enough 
  - use disk
    - create a file name for each url using its hash key
    - search whether a file has been created

### Reference
- Not enough memory: use disk storage
  - create file to store url: hash(url)%400
