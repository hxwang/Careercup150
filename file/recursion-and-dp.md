## Recursion and Dynamic Programming

- 9.1 A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways to child can run up the stairs. [[Solution]](../code/9.1.java)

- 9.2 Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there for the robot to go from (0,0) to (X,Y) [[Solution]](../code/9.2.java)
  - Imagine certain spots are "off limit", such that the robot cannot step on them. Design and implement algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
