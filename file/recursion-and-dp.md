## Recursion and Dynamic Programming

- 9.1 A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways to child can run up the stairs. [[Solution]](../code/9.1.java)

- 9.2 Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there for the robot to go from (0,0) to (X,Y) [[Solution]](../code/9.2.java)
  - Imagine certain spots are "off limit", such that the robot cannot step on them. Design and implement algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

- 9.3 A magic index in an array A[0...n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A [[Solution]](../code/9.3.java)
  - what if the values are not distinct?

- 9.4 Write a method to return all subset of a set. [[Solution]](https://github.com/hxwang/Leetcode/blob/master/code/Subsets.java)

- 9.5 Write a method to compute all permutations of a string.
