## Trees and Graphs

- 4.0 [[DFS, BFS]](../code/4.0.java)

- 4.1 Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to bea tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one. [[Solution]](../code/4.1.java)

- 4.2 Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes? [[Solution]](../code/4.2.java)

- 4.3 Given a sorted (increasing order) array, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
