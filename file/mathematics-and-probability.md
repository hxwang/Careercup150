## Mathematics and Probability

- 7.0 [Get List of Primes](../code/7.0.java)
- 7.1 You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games. [[Solution]](../code/7.1.md)
  - Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
  - Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
  - If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

- 7.2 There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed. [[Solution]](../code/7.2.md)
  - Similarly, find the probability of collison with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

- 7.3 Given two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would intersect. [[Solution]](../code/7.3.java)

- 7.4 Write methods to implement the multiply, subtract, and divide operations for integers. Use only add operator.
