## Brain Teaser

- 6.1 You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grames. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle. You can only use the scale once. [[Solution]](../code/6.1.java)

- 6.2 There is an 8*8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You have given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible) [[Solution]](../code/6.2.java)

- 6.3 You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). Houw would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly half of the jug would be impossible. [[Solution]](../code/6.3.java)

- 6.4 A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color but they do not know there own (nor does anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave? [[Solution]](../code/6.4.java)

- 6.5 There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case. [[Solution]](../code/6.5.java)
