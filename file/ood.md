## Object-Oriented Design

- 8.0 [[Singleton Class and Factory Class]](../code/8.0.java)

- 8.1 Design the data structure for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack. [[Solution]](../code/8.1.java)

- 8.2 Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allcoated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be ascalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assign a call to the first available employee. [[Solution]](../code/8.2.java)
