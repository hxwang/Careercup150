## Sorting and Searching

- 11.1 You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order. [[Solution]](https://github.com/hxwang/Leetcode/blob/master/code/Merge-Sorted-Array.java)

- 11.2 Write a method to sort an array of strings so that al the anagrams are next to each other. [[Solution]](../code/11-2.java)

- 11.3 Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in ascending order. [[Solution]](https://github.com/hxwang/Leetcode/blob/master/code/Search-in-Rotated-Sorted-Array.java)
  - Example: find 5 in {15, 16, 19, 20, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14}

- 11.4 Imagine you have a 20GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file. [[Solution]](../code/11-4.md)
