## Linked Lists

- 2.1. Write code to remove duplicats from an unsorted linked list, how would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed? [[Solution]](../code/2.1.java)
- 2.2. Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. [[Solution]](https://github.com/hxwang/Leetcode/blob/master/code/Remove-Nth-Node-From-End-of-List.java)
- 2.3. Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
Example: input a->b->c->d->e, output: a->b->d->e [[Solution]](../code/2.3.java)
- 2.4. Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. [[Solution]](https://github.com/hxwang/Leetcode/blob/master/code/Partition-List.java)
- 2.5 You have two numbers represetned by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

EXAMPLE: Input: 7->1->6 + 5->9->2, that is 617 + 912 
Output: 2->1->9. That is, 912.
- 2.6 Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node at the beginning of the loop. [[Solution]](https://github.com/hxwang/Leetcode/blob/master/code/Linked-List-Cycle-II.java)
- 2.7 Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
