## Linked Lists

- 2.1. Write code to remove duplicats from an unsorted linked list, how would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed? [[Solution]](../code/2.1.java)
- 2.2. Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. [[Solution]](https://github.com/hxwang/Leetcode/blob/master/code/Remove-Nth-Node-From-End-of-List.java)
- 2.3. Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
Example: input a->b->c->d->e, output: a->b->d->e [[Solution]](../code/2.3.java)
